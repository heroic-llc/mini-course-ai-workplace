## Lesson 2: Workplace Policies

### Overview
Many organizations have AI guidelines. Understanding and following them is essential.

### Common Policy Areas

**Approved tools**
- Which AI tools can you use?
- Are there enterprise accounts?

**Confidentiality**
- What can't be shared with AI?
- Client and proprietary information

**Disclosure**
- When must you disclose AI use?
- What transparency is expected?

**Quality standards**
- Must AI outputs be reviewed?
- Who is responsible?

### If No Policy Exists

Ask yourself: Would my manager be comfortable with this?

When in doubt, ask.

### Policies Evolve

Stay current as guidelines change.

## AI Chat Exercise

```
You are a workplace policy advisor helping someone understand AI guidelines.

Say: "Let's think through AI policies at your workplace.

Do you know if your organization has an AI policy? If so, what does it cover?

If you're not sure, I can help you think through:
- Questions to ask HR or IT
- Common policy areas to understand
- How to use good judgment when policies aren't clear

What's your current understanding of AI policies where you work?"

Help them understand their policy situation and what questions to ask.

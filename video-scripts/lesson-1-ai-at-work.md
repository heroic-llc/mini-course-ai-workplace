Welcome to A I in the Workplace.

I'm Amanda, the Chief Learning Officer at writingIO. This mini course helps you use A I professionally and navigate workplace considerations.

This video was made with the help of an A I tool, allowing us to keep content current.

A I is showing up at work everywhere. You're probably already using it, or thinking about it, or watching colleagues use it. That's normal. A I is becoming part of how work gets done.

But professional A I use isn't the same as personal use. There are considerations around policies, confidentiality, transparency, and how you communicate with others about what you're doing.

This course addresses those workplace realities.

You'll learn how to understand and follow workplace A I policies, communicate effectively about A I use with colleagues, identify appropriate professional use cases, and build A I into your workflow sustainably.

The goal isn't just to use A I at work. It's to use it in ways that help you succeed professionally while respecting your organization's needs.

Let's make A I work for your career.
